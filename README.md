# Deep_Learning_Basic_Python

This repository was used to record and review the python code about the deep learning. All the code came from a book and I also added some comments. This book was "Introduction to Deep learning: Python-based theory and implementation" in English, written by a Japanese - Koki Saitoh.

Note: The code in this repository could be shared but not for commercial use.

The file's name was just copyed and pasted, which would be named something like "book_given_function.py".
