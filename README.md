# Deep_Learning_Basic_Python

This repository was used to record and review the basic python code about the deep learning. All the code came from a book and I also added some comments. This book was "Introduction to Deep learning: Python based theory and implementation" in English, written by a Japanese - Koki Saitoh.

**His Twitter: 斎藤康毅 (@SaitohKoki)**

Note: The code in this repository could be shared but NOT for commercial use.

The code in files named "book_given_function.py" was just copied and paste directly from the book. 

BUT the rest of code was totally understood and could be explained clearly by myself.
